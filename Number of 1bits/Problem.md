## 🔍 Examples

### Example 1:
- **Input:**  
  `n = 11`
- **Output:**  
  `3`
- **Explanation:**  
  The binary representation of `11` is `1011`, which contains **three set bits**.

---

### Example 2:
- **Input:**  
  `n = 128`
- **Output:**  
  `1`
- **Explanation:**  
  The binary representation of `128` is `10000000`, which contains **one set bit**.

---

### Example 3:
- **Input:**  
  `n = 2147483645`
- **Output:**  
  `30`
- **Explanation:**  
  The binary representation of `2147483645` is `1111111111111111111111111111101`, which contains **thirty set bits**.
